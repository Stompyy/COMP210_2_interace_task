## AR/VR interface proposal

## Augmented reality game for mobile devices

Fight your stuff!

Use your mobile device's screen as a window into a world where enemies and bonuses spawn from the items and shapes in your environment.

Shoot them with an on screen crosshair before they attack you.

Larger items such as laptops and keyboards will spawn larger and more deadly enemies than pencils and coins.

Some of the stronger enemies may need special techniques to defeat them such as aiming around their armour.

By identifying the shapes and relative size of items in your environment, enemy sizes, shapes, and power will alter dramatically. Imagine a swarm of small golden baddies coming from the coins on your coffee table, whilst a large lumbering boss comes out from behind the television.

## Research

Many augmented reality games are being released for mobile devices and this game takes inspiration from successes such as [Zombie Gunship Revenant AR](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zombie-gunship-revenant-ar/id1254976492?mt=8)

and [AR Clay Shooting](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ar-clay-shooting/id1253385830?mt=8),  
[BATTLE BEARS ZOMBIES AR](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battle-bears-zombies-ar/id326979430?mt=8),  
[Space Shooter AR](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-shooter-ar/id963122285?mt=8),  
and [SpaceShooter - AugmentedReality](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spaceshooter-augmentedreality/id1247861098?mt=8).

All attempt to map their game as a layer onto the camera's live feed, but none, as far as I know, take information from the environment and use it to affect the gameplay significantly.
